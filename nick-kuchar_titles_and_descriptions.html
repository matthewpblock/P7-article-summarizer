        <h2>See Oahu's North Shore - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>This print captures the feeling you get while cruising along the North Shore on Kamehameha Highway. You start your drive by passing iconic Haleiwa Town, and then past famous surf spots like Chun's reef, Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach with surfboards and dog in tow.
Nick's Commentary: "I always say that my art imitates life and no print more-so than this 'See Oahu's North Shore' design.  That spotted pup is Jake who lived a long life of 15 years.  He loved cruising in our Volkswagen van perched on the back seat with his nose sticking out the window.  We had some great times at Chun's."

        <p>On the north shore of Kaua‘i sits beautiful Hanalei Town.  A great town to paddle out for a surf, soak up the local culture or spend time on your way to the Nā Pali coast.
Nick's Commentary: "This is one the of most beautiful places on earth. The pier that juts out to sea is so iconic.  Whether looking makai at the expansive Hanalei Bay or mauka at the lush mountain ridges I love taking in the views of this place."

        <h2>Diamond Head Crater - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>One of the most iconic views of O'ahu is Diamond Head from the shores of Waikiki. Bring to your home the feeling of palm trees swaying in the tradewinds as an outrigger floats by.
Nick's Commentary: "Waikiki is a truly amazing place that you can enjoy from so many different perspectives:  Sitting in the lineup at Canoes or Queen's looking back at the coastline, relaxing at the Moana Surfrider, enjoying Mai Tai as outriggers pass on the horizon or taking a sunset sail out and around Diamond Head for a unique view.  I like to remember that these are the same views that Duke Kahanamoku and the Waikiki Beach Boys saw around 100 years ago. Duke was an olympic swimmer and the one who's influence turned Waikiki into a surfing hotspot."

        <h2>On The Beach In Waikiki - 12x18 - Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>Nick's Commentary: A much requested print, I illustrated the Pink Palace of the Pacific. “On The Beach In Waikīkī” celebrates the iconic stretch of beach and that beautiful soft pink tone easily seen from the surf lineups nearby. The experience of dropping into waves at one of the birthplaces of surfing where many famous names have paddled before is humbling. Any time you can catch waves while you can hear ukulele strumming beachside is truly unique.

        <h2>Kona Manta Rays - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>When the Sheraton Kona was being built in the 70's the construction lights attracted plankton which in turn attracted large Manta Rays close to shore.  This has become an incredible underwater experience to dive or snorkel with these magnificent fish right off of the coast on Hawai‘i island.

        <h2>Kona Village - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>This print's inspired by the legendary Kona Village Resort - a Hawai‘i Island treasure known for its thatched-roof hale, black lava shoreline, and cultural roots. This piece celebrates the peaceful beauty of the property’s architecture and natural surroundings, transporting you to a place where time slows down.
Once a favorite escape for movie stars, musicians, and artists, Kona Village offered a kind of barefoot luxury that’s hard to find these days. It was the kind of place where you might spot a Hollywood legend sipping coffee by the beach, or hear stories passed down over pupus at sunset.
This print is a visual tribute to that spirit and the quiet magic of the Kona Coast. It's perfect for anyone who holds memories of the resort close, or for those who simply appreciate vintage Hawai‘i charm and timeless design. Designed in partnership with the good folks at Kona Village Resort.

        <h2>Haleiwa Wahine - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>The Hale‘iwa Wahine strums her ukulele under the palms as sailboats sit in the harbor and surfers drop in in the distance.  The retro orange and aqua color palette completes this nostalgic illustration of the "Gateway to the North Shore."
Nick's Commentary: "The quiet little surf town of Hale‘iwa has a unique charm whether you are on the hunt for surf, sushi or Hawaii made art.  The word 'Hale‘iwa' literally translates to "House of the frigate bird, or ‘Iwa. I get a special feeling when you emerge from the Cook Pines on the way to the North Shore and see the historic Haleiwa Town sign.  I thought it was important to feature several of the iconic landmarks like the Rainbow Bridge over Anahulu Stream & the buoy off in the distance entering the harbor."

        <p>Makapu‘u Lighthouse is an iconic paved walk on Oahu with breathtaking views of the windward coast.
Nick's Commentary:  "I love everything about this area of Oahu. Views of Maui Nui on clear days, spotting humpback whales, and watching the paragliders catch thermals on the Koolau mountains set the mood for this walk on the coast.  You can see Rabbit island and most of the windward side.  Also there's something nostalgic and charming about lighthouses in general.  For the extra adventurous, on calm days you can explore the tide pools below."

Beautiful and historic Lahaina, the original Capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom was tragically destroyed by fire in August 2023.
As a company, we have given over $65,000 to date to relief efforts.  While we know that's only a very small part of a long rebuilding effort we continue to stand with our friends on Maui to help recovery and rebuilding.

In Hawaiian mythology, this basalt islet in Kāne‘ohe Bay is known to be the tip of a lizard's tail.
Nick's Commentary:
"I designed this print to capture the silhouetted sunrise beauty of Mokoli‘i from the view of Kualoa Regional Park.  I love the way the palms meet the sand and create a visual foreground to the view out to sea. My favorite memory of this spot was kayaking with my wife out to the island, docking our boat and hiking to the top for some amazing views looking back to the Ko‘olau Mountains."

        <h2>Lanikai - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>Beautiful Lanikai! From the white sand beaches to the Pillbox at the top of the Ka‘iwa Ridge trail to the majestic Mokulua islands, Lanikai is an amazing place to so many.
**Unique to this print we are offering a limited run of Ka'ōhao prints.  We know that this area is known to many as Lanikai! In addition, lots of locals also know this special place by its original name of Ka'ōhao and wanted to feature that to encapsulate a simpler time of watermelon farms and wide open spaces. To order simply select the version you'd prefer from the dropdown menu.
Nick's Commentary: "My favorite view in all of Hawai‘i could be paddling to the Mokulua islands and looking back on a calm clear day toward the shoreline with the Ko‘olau mountains in the distance.  As soon as you drive past the iconic monument at the beginning of Lanikai you know you've entered a special place.  This is a location in Hawaii that can feel so different based on the time of day which I love: The bright optimistic yellows of sunrise, bright blue skies contrasting the bright white sand at midday and the cool evenings after the sun has already set over the Ko‘olau."

Nick's Commentary: "This is such a beautiful part of the island. Hiking around Koko Head or up Koko Crater is a quick respite from the busyness of Honolulu.  The view I illustrated is from the neighboring Koko Head (above Hanauma bay) looking toward Koko Crater to the north east. I love the clear days you can see Lana‘i off to the east."

Nick's Commentary:
"I originally designed this print in collaboration with the Historic Hawaii Foundation.  It was fascinating looking through 100 year old photos and learning about the the town's buildings, signage over the years and place in Honolulu history. I wanted to capture the diverse architecture like the Spanish style fire station, mid century modern look of the Superette and Art Deco feel of the Queen Theatre. Iconic views of Palolo and the Ko‘olau Mountains round out this nostalgic look at the "Top of the Hill Town'."

Nick's Commentary: "I created this print in conjunction with the Kona Historical Society and Dale Hope who always has such a wealth of knowledge on Hawaii's history and landscape. The island of Hawai‘i is full of diverse and open spaces. At times the Kona Coast would look more like a rocky desert as opposed to your quintessiential 'Hawaii Postcard' image...but, there's beauty and majesty in that.  A raw yet beautiful landscape that has created sustenance for generations, brought world class Coffee and Beef to the world and also provided a place for people to explore the ‘aina from mauka to makai."

        <h2>Kahala Beach - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>Located close to Diamond Head and home to a well known resort, Kāhala Beach is an enchanting south shore destination.
Nick's Commentary: "Our family spent a lot of time here during the craziness that was 2020.  I think we'll remember it fondly as a place we forgot about cares and worries and just enjoyed the scenery. I also love the little palm-lined jetty that extends from the east end of the beach.  The turquoise water of nearby Maunalua Bay is featured as you look east toward Koko Head."

Nick's Commentary: "I had a lot of fun creating this print because it's one of my favorite places.  It's a surreal experience to hike to the northwest tip of O‘ahu and watch huge albatross fly overhead.  When there's a big north swell, the monstrous waves rolling in are a spectacle.  Here I've hiked, mountain biked, and just sat appreciating this area."

In the 1800's it became residential, then industrial and back to residential again and is an urban community with shops and dining located just a walk from the beach.
Nick’s commentary: “A long requested print (Kewalos,too!) this print celebrates the bustling area of Kaka‘ako. Residents walk to and from the many activities in the area to show the lively cityscape. There’s also a hint at the pili grass texture that was used to thatch traditional Hawaiian structures."

Nick's Commentary: "I love the cluster of coconut palms at the base of the air control tower blowing from east to west as fighter jets train overhead. There are lots of historic elements to incorporate in this piece along with the backdrop of the Wai‘anae mountains.  If you have the chance to go, there is an amazing little aviation museum located here that is fascinating to explore.  The ferry in the foreground has a really interesting history of its own, the
Moko Holo Hele
which was sunk of the coast in 2017 into 9000' of water unfortunately because an agreement couldn't be reached to turn it into an artificial reef in shallower water."

When our dog jake passed away in 2013 my wife and I paddled out from Waimanalo beach to have a little 'ceremony' for him and put a lei in the water to remember him. This coastline will always have special meaning to me."

Nick's Commentary: "I set out to capture two things when designing this print for the M20 Paddleboard Race Championships – the iconic experience of the event through the visualization of determined competitors and the heavy water of the 'Channel of Bones'. The deep greens add to the magnificence and depth of the channel and provide a sense of the unknown. Each athlete embarks on a personal journey during the race, so I am honored to contribute to their accomplishment."

Nick's Commentary: "One of the most breathtaking colors in Hawaii is the electric turquoise blue water of Hickam Harbor.  It always grabs your attention if you are sitting on Hickam beach or taxiing by on the reef runway.   That plane in the background? It's the same model that was flown by Pan Am on many flights to the islands.  Back in 1956, a flight on its way to San Francisco, CA crashed in the Pacific. Luckily everyone survived due the flying skills of Capt. Richard Ogg."

        <p>"The Gateway to the North Shore, "The Place of Noise", "Wahiawā, Historic Plantation Town," whatever you call Wahiawā, this town in the center of O‘ahu has an interesting and storied history. This print was originally designed for Surfing the Nations founder, Tom Bauer for the non-profit's 10 year anniversary in Wahiawā and Tom's 70th Birthday.  Keep reading below for inspiration and story behind the piece.
Nick's Commentary: "I was stoked to create this print for an area that’s achieved such transformation in the last decade.  Central O‘ahu is home to the Kūkaniloko birth stones, a sacred site for Hawaiians and a place where Ali‘i were born.  In contrast, downtown Wahiawā has had a history in more recent times of strip clubs and other venues that exploit women. Over the past ten years Wahiawā has experienced quite a rebirth thanks to the work of Surfing the Nations. You can see a subtle hint to the Kūkaniloko stones at the bottom of the piece.  The open maile lei suggests a Hāpai women symbolizing fertility and growth.  The Wai‘anae range in the background with Mt. Ka‘ala is a welcome sight for Wahiawā residents as well as those passing through on their way to the North Shore.  The piece features yellows and greens to recognize the history of the pineapple plantations and colors of the local high school, Leilehua."

Nick's Commentary: "There were several features of Mākaha beach I wanted to include, like the backwash of the shorebreak as the waves rush back out to see.  What a unique added experience of surfing a world class wave, riding it close to shore and then anticipate the previous wave rushing back out to you from the steep sandy shelf.  At Mākaha you'll see talented watermen (and women) riding surf craft of all different shapes and sizes.  If you don't surf and want to simply enjoy the scenery you can easily grab shade under the false Kamani trees along the shore.  Also I wanted to include a subtle hint of the honu just as subtle as their playful presence underwater in the distance."
