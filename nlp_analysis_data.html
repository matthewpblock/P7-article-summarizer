        <h2>See Oahu's North Shore - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>This print captures the feeling you get while cruising along the North Shore on Kamehameha Highway. You start your drive by passing iconic Haleiwa Town, and then past famous surf spots like Chun's reef, Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach with surfboards and dog in tow.
Nick's Commentary: "I always say that my art imitates life and no print more-so than this 'See Oahu's North Shore' design.  That spotted pup is Jake who lived a long life of 15 years.  He loved cruising in our Volkswagen van perched on the back seat with his nose sticking out the window.  We had some great times at Chun's."

        <h2>Hanalei Bay, Kauai - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>On the north shore of Kaua‘i sits beautiful Hanalei Town.  A great town to paddle out for a surf, soak up the local culture or spend time on your way to the Nā Pali coast.
Nick's Commentary: "This is one the of most beautiful places on earth. The pier that juts out to sea is so iconic.  Whether looking makai at the expansive Hanalei Bay or mauka at the lush mountain ridges I love taking in the views of this place."

        <h2>Diamond Head Crater - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>One of the most iconic views of O'ahu is Diamond Head from the shores of Waikiki. Bring to your home the feeling of palm trees swaying in the tradewinds as an outrigger floats by.
Nick's Commentary: "Waikiki is a truly amazing place that you can enjoy from so many different perspectives:  Sitting in the lineup at Canoes or Queen's looking back at the coastline, relaxing at the Moana Surfrider, enjoying Mai Tai as outriggers pass on the horizon or taking a sunset sail out and around Diamond Head for a unique view.  I like to remember that these are the same views that Duke Kahanamoku and the Waikiki Beach Boys saw around 100 years ago. Duke was an olympic swimmer and the one who's influence turned Waikiki into a surfing hotspot."

        <h2>On The Beach In Waikiki - 12x18 - Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>Nick's Commentary: A much requested print, I illustrated the Pink Palace of the Pacific. “On The Beach In Waikīkī” celebrates the iconic stretch of beach and that beautiful soft pink tone easily seen from the surf lineups nearby. The experience of dropping into waves at one of the birthplaces of surfing where many famous names have paddled before is humbling. Any time you can catch waves while you can hear ukulele strumming beachside is truly unique.

        <h2>Kilauea Volcano - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>It's amazing to think that we live on an island in the middle of the Pacific formed by a volcano.  Molten lava is still flowing on Hawai‘i Island out of Kīlauea Volcano.  Inside Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park you can watch in awe around you as active lava comes to the surface and cools into hardened black rock.

        <h2>Kona Manta Rays - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>When the Sheraton Kona was being built in the 70's the construction lights attracted plankton which in turn attracted large Manta Rays close to shore.  This has become an incredible underwater experience to dive or snorkel with these magnificent fish right off of the coast on Hawai‘i island.

        <h2>Kona Village - 12x18 Hawaii Travel Print</h2>
        <p>This print's inspired by the legendary Kona Village Resort - a Hawai‘i Island treasure known for its thatched-roof hale, black lava shoreline, and cultural roots. This piece celebrates the peaceful beauty of the property’s architecture and natural surroundings, transporting you to a place where time slows down.
Once a favorite escape for movie stars, musicians, and artists, Kona Village offered a kind of barefoot luxury that’s hard to find these days. It was the kind of place where you might spot a Hollywood legend sipping coffee by the beach, or hear stories passed down over pupus at sunset.
This print is a visual tribute to that spirit and the quiet magic of the Kona Coast. It's perfect for anyone who holds memories of the resort close, or for those who simply appreciate vintage Hawai‘i charm and timeless design. Designed in partnership with the good folks at Kona Village Resort.
